          Over the last week, critics and defenders of the National Security Agency have heatedly debated the merits of metadata -- information about the phone activity of millions of Americans that was given to the government via a secret court order.  The information collected includes records of every call placed on the Verizon communications network (and, it appears, every other U.S. phone carrier) including times, dates, lengths of calls, and the phone numbers of the participants, but not the names associated with the accounts.

I was saying recently to a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would be one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?

          Throughout most of Silicon Valley’s history, its executives have displayed a libertarian instinct to stay as far from politics and government as possible.  But the imperative to change the world has recently led some Silicon Valley leaders to imagine that the values and concepts behind their success can be uploaded to the public sphere.

The techniques of analysis that had proved so effective were left behind at the office at the end of the day and picked up again the next morning.  The imposition, on oneself or one’s family, of a regime of objective record keeping seemed ridiculous.

          We see a similar pattern in other kinds of consumption.  Think of the restaurants cherished by very wealthy New Yorkers.  Masa, where a meal for two can cost $1,500, is on the list, but so is a cheap Sichuan spot in Queens, a Papaya Dog and a favorite place for a slice.  Sociologists have a name for this.

          In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I started a startup called Viaweb.  Our plan was to write software that would let end users build online stores.  What was novel about this software, at the time, was that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages as the interface. A lot of people could have been having this idea at the same time, of course, but as far as I know, Viaweb was the first Web-based application.

Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved a type structure; created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve a meager programming environment, it has become one of the dominant languages of today.

Although the documentation and examples are excellent, I thought it would be interesting to review the code on a more technical level.  Hopefully this will give readers a deeper understanding of Backbone, and as the MVC series progresses these code reviews should prove useful in accurately comparing the many competing frameworks.

          Fear is an emotion that slows teams down.  It makes us more cautious.  It makes us over-invest in prevention.  It makes us less willing to trust, to communicate openly, and - most painfully - to take risks.  It is the dominant reason I see teams fall back on "best practices" which may not be effective, but are at least reassuring.

If people can't do it, then it is hard, at least for them.

The techniques of analysis that had proved so effective were left behind at the office at the end of the day and picked up again the next morning.  The imposition, on oneself or one’s family, of a regime of objective record keeping seemed ridiculous.

That’s the simplistic experience dating sites would like you to believe exists.

It’s a precious tool that helps uncover missed opportunities and dollars left on the table. I’d like to present a handful of case studies and A/B tests that indicate a streamlined, “no BS” e-commerce flow with elegant user experience—where the site is honest and clear with visitors about how checkout works and what happens next—usually takes the cake for best conversion rate.

          If you’ve bought a bottle of spring water recently—a little, half-liter one, the single serve kind—you may have noticed how fragile it was.

          Consider the following: At the end of 1963 , virtually no one in America had heard of the Beatles.  Yet on Feb. 9, 1964, they drew the largest TV audience in history-73 million viewers-when they appeared on "The Ed Sullivan Show."  How could such a conquest have occurred so quickly?  I once asked my friend Lenny Kaye that question, and he answered: "Everybody was ready for the '60s to begin."

It was a feeling of coming home,” he says.  As the anxiety he’d been facing for a lifetime began to disappear, too, tears of joy welled up in his eyes.

          E-commerce was king this past holiday season, with Christmas surge orders overwhelming UPS’s systems and forcing $100 million in upgrades to prevent future fiascos.  So it was no surprise on Jan. 30 when Amazon reported it had become even more enormous than ever before.  According to its latest earnings report, the online shopping giant's net sales increased 20 percent compared with the previous holiday season—a number that would seem staggeringly high if it weren't so routine for a company that’s been growing rapidly for years.
